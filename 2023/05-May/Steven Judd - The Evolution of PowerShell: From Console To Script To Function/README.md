### Summary

Steven Judd joins us to talk about the transition from one-liner code to progressing into scripts and functions.

This is a hybrid event. You can attend in-person or online via Microsoft Teams. See below for important details for attending in-person.

Meeting Description:
Join us for a journey through the progression of PowerShell as it is used to solve an example problem. It starts with running a console command, progresses to running a script, enhances the script, pivots to a function, and finishes up with an Advanced Function.

Along the way, you will see some "best practices" that will help you with your PowerShell coding. No matter where you are on your PowerShell journey, this presentation will help you move to the next stage of advancing your skill. The target audience is beginner to intermediate.
