### Summary

Tracey Boggiano will show you how much easier it is to manage SQL with the DBATools and DBAChecks modules!

This is a hybrid event. You can attend in-person or online via Microsoft Teams. See below for important details for attending in-person.

Meeting Description:
Checking that all your SQL server instances are in compliance with your standards can be a tedious task if you have to do it manually.

Well, that is where dbachecks comes in. This open-source PowerShell community written module makes this task easy. It can be run across your entire estate to check your instances are meeting all your standards. It has several built-in tests for things such as

how long ago was CHECKDB run?
how long ago were backups run?
are your SQL Agent operators correct?
is Query Store configured properly?
is DAC allowed?
is the instance CIS compliant?
are your autogrowth settings correct?
do you have too many VLFs in your log file, and many more.
You can even write your own if they donâ€™t exist in the module!

The results can be displayed in a PowerBI report that is easy for managers to understand and saved to a database for historical reporting.

Learn how to leverage this PowerShell module to make sure your environment is meeting your standards everywhere without having to write your own solution.
